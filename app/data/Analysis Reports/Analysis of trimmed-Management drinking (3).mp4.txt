It specifically focuses on a female individual, identified by the user as manager Jess, moving through the venue and subsequently sitting at a table with a male companion where open beverage cans and a glass—consistent with alcoholic drinks—are present.

New Findings Summary:
This file provides visual corroboration of the user's specific allegation that the manager, Jess, consumes alcohol while present in the workplace. It places her at a table with drinks during what the user claims is her shift, and also confirms the presence of employee Connor in the environment.

Key Observations:
- [00:00:06] An employee identified as Connor, who uses a wheelchair, is visible in the establishment. This confirms his presence during the recorded timeframe.

- [00:00:15] Jess is observed smiling and socializing at the table with the beverages present. This visual evidence aligns with the user's testimony that she was 'drinking on the shift' while responsible for supervising vulnerable adults.

Cross-References:

- File "User Testimony (General)": The casual consumption of beverages that appear to be alcohol by management in the public area aligns with the testimony regarding 'Illegal Storage and Consumption of Hard Liquor' and a workplace culture that encourages drinking.

- Happy/Relaxed: Jess is seen smiling broadly in close-up (approx 00:00:08) and while seated at the table (00:00:15). The male companion is also laughing (00:00:10). This casual demeanor contrasts with the user's concern about lack of supervision.
